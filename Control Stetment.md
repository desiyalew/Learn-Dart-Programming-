An Introduction to Control Structures

==> Introduction
Control structures can be thought of as blocks of code that determine or dictate the flow in which statements (lines of code) are executed; they are basically statements that control the flow of code (control flow statements). For instance, a block of code can flow in a sequential manner where a control structure ensures its statements are executed sequentially. A block of code can also flow in an iterative manner where there are control structures that ensure its statements are executed iteratively.

==> Control Flow Statements in Dart

Dart provides multiple statements that can be used to control the flow of your Dart code.

We will be discussing the following statements in this chapter:
1. if and else
2. for loops
3. while and do-while loops
4. break and continue
5. switch and case
6. assert
