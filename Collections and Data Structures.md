Collections and Data Structures

Collections are objects that group other objects together according to a conceptual schema. For example, a dictionary is a collection of words and a card deck is a collection of cards.

Another name for collections is data structures and there is a good reason for that. Data structures are a means of structuring data. They are used to store, manipulate, and retrieve all types of data.

Dart’s Collection
Unlike most programming languages, Dart doesn’t have a large collection of built-in data structures. Rather, it has three core built-in collections that can be used to create collections based on an individual’s needs. Those three collections are List, Set, and Map.

As discussed, List, Set, and Map are all types in Dart. A variable can be of the above three types along with the primitive types we discussed in the third chapter.

In this chapter, we will be looking at each of the core collections in detail.
