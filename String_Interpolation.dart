/*
String Interpolation#
the process of string evaluating a string containing placeholder, variables and interpolated expressions.
String interpolation is the ability to create new strings or modify existing ones by embedding them with expressions. Expressions are evaluated, and the resulting values are converted into strings and concatenated with the enclosing string. Interpolation is Dartâ€™s more concise and efficient alternative to string concatenation. However, string interpolation is a lot more complex than simple concatenation which allows a lot more flexibility.

Syntax#
An un-escaped $ character in a string signifies the beginning of an interpolated expression.

The $ sign can be followed by a single identifier id that does not contain the $ character.

"optional string $variableIdentifier  optional string";

The $ sign can also be followed by an expression delimited by curly brackets.

  "optional string ${expression}  optional string";
