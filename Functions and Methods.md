/*
Functions#
In computer programming, a function or a method is a block of 
code that performs a specific task. The block of code is given a name,
 much like a variable. 
The function is called using this name whenever that specific task needs to be performed. 
This removes the need to type the same code over and over again; 
all you have to do is call the function’s name

Functions in Dart
We can divide functions into two broad categories:
1. Built-In Functions
2. User-Defined Functions
=>User-defined functions are functions that users create themselves. 
We have a whole chapter dedicated to just these, so they aren’t of any concern to us now.

=>Built-in functions are functions that are predefined by Dart and are part of their libraries. 
All we have to do to use them is call their function name.
